Working with tasks
==================


Running a task
--------------

Specifying dependencies
-----------------------

confusing to perform the whole vertical process manually

Saving results
--------------

want to avoid repeating heavy computations

see :ref:`saving_results` for more details.

Configuration
-------------

can be cumbersome to provide all arguments to build the task every time

See :ref:`Configuration` for more details.
